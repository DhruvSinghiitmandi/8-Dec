üéØ Problem Recap (in brief terms):

From a filtered set of rows (based on business metric thresholds), select P = 5 rows that:

Are "interesting" (via diversity, novelty, or informativeness),

Optimize a global score (e.g. precision, recall),

Avoid near-duplicate metric profiles (encourage variance).

üß† SOLUTION SPACE (Grouped Thematically)

üîπ 1. Diversity + Relevance Tradeoff Heuristics

a. Greedy Relevance + Distance Threshold

Sort by global metric (e.g., recall)

Pick top rows greedily, but skip rows too similar (Euclidean distance in metric space below threshold)


b. Clustering-based Selection

Cluster shortlisted rows (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN) in metric space

Pick the most representative (e.g., centroid or highest global score) from each cluster

Ensures diversity with some structure


c. Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)

Iteratively select rows that maximize:

Œª * relevance - (1 - Œª) * similarity_to_selected

Balances high-score rows with low redundancy



---

üîπ 2. Mathematical Optimization Techniques

a. Submodular Optimization

Define a submodular utility function (e.g., coverage, dispersion)

Greedily maximize with constraint (|S| = P)

Libraries: submodlib, apricot


b. Integer Programming with Constraints

Maximize sum of global metric scores

Subject to diversity constraints:

E.g., pairwise distances above threshold

Or enforce 1 row per metric-based bin/cluster



c. Pareto Optimization (Multi-Objective)

Treat each business metric as an objective

Find Pareto-efficient set (non-dominated rows)

Select diverse subset from the Pareto front



---

üîπ 3. Sampling-based / Probabilistic Approaches

a. Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs)

Probabilistically select diverse subsets

Use similarity kernel (e.g., RBF on metric space)

Can be biased towards high-score rows


b. Weighted k-Means Sampling

Weight each row by global score

Apply k-means in metric space

Sample highest score row from each cluster


c. Monte Carlo Sampling with Diversity Penalty

Sample multiple sets of P rows

Score each set by:

Sum of global metric

Minus a penalty for low variance or high similarity


Keep top sets



---

üîπ 4. Learning-Based Approaches

a. Active Learning for Interestingness

Train a model (possibly weak) to predict "developer interest"

Use uncertainty sampling or diversity sampling to pick top rows


b. Autoencoder + Latent Space Diversity

Train an autoencoder on business metrics

Select rows that are far in latent space and score high


c. Contrastive Embeddings + Clustering

Learn contrastive representations where similar metric profiles are close

Select diverse rows based on learned space



---

üîπ 5. Statistical / Rule-Based Approaches

a. Quantile Binning Across Metrics

Divide each metric into quantiles (e.g., tertiles)

Pick rows that span different quantile combinations

Ensures diversity and interpretability


b. Top-N in Mutually Exclusive Ranges

Manually or algorithmically define ‚Äúinteresting zones‚Äù (e.g., low offer_rate + high ipa)

Select top rows from each zone


c. Z-score / Outlier Biasing

Compute z-scores for metrics

Bias selection toward rows with high global score and at least one metric far from the mean



---

üîπ 6. Hybrid / Heuristic Solutions

a. Score + Cluster + Filter

1. Rank all rows by global metric


2. Cluster top-N (e.g., top 50)


3. Select top-scoring row from each of the P clusters



b. Diversity-aware Beam Search

Keep multiple ‚Äúcandidate subsets‚Äù of size P

At each step, expand subsets with a new candidate row that increases diversity or utility

Keep top-k subsets


c. Scoring Matrix + Greedy Cover

Create a matrix: each row‚Äôs contribution to global metric and to metric diversity (e.g., variance gain)

Greedily build a set maximizing both objectives
